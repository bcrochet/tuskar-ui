tuskar-ui
=========

**tuskar-ui** is a user interface for
`Tuskar <https://github.com/tuskar/tuskar>`__, a management API for
OpenStack deployments. It is based on (and forked from) `OpenStack
Horizon <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Horizon>`__.

High-Level Overview
-------------------

Tuskar-UI endeavours to be a stateless UI, relying on Tuskar API calls 
as much as possible. We use existing Horizon libraries and components 
where possible. If added libraries and components are needed, we will 
work with the OpenStack community to push those changes back into Horizon.
